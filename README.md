# My Advent of Code solutions
Towards the end of the year, I brush up my coding skills with these challenges.
I tend to wake up early for the first few challenges but after a week or so, life catches up.

## Running individual solutions
With the current setup, everything needed for a single solution can be found under `YYYY/day_DD`.
The input should be placed in the same folder as `input.txt`.

## TODOs

- [ ] Use library (make creating solutions easier and allow others to run your code on their input)
