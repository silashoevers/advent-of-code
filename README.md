# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges throughout the years. I have started participating actively since 2021.

## Background
### Language of Choice
My language of choice is Python because I am the most comfortable with it, and it facilitates a high coding speed

### Libraries used
- [pytest](https://pytest.org)

### Why this repository?
I hope this repository is able to illustrate the type of code I personally like to produce.

## Repository structure
A lot of inspiration has been taken from [this](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/) article on Real Python.
It has inspired me to make use of a TDD approach next to providing me with useful libraries and templates to use.

### Naming scheme
Solutions are grouped per year in folders named `YYYY`.
Individual solutions are seperated by folder as well in the format `DD_name_of_challenge`.
The filename of the actual solution is `aocYYYYDD.py` and the test is prefixed with `test_`.
Example and actual input are put in files named `exampleX.txt` and `input.txt` respectively.
