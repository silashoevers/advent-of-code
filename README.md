# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges throughout the years. I have started participating actively since 2021.

## Background

### Inspiration
Credits to [Tom Meulenkamp](https://github.com/supertom01) for providing [the basic framework](https://github.com/supertom01/adventOfCode)

### Language of Choice
My language of choice is Python because I am the most comfortable with it and it facilitates a high coding speed.
Next to that I believe I can produce the most readable code with this language.

## Structure

Input files are pulled from the AoC website and cached under `/input/YYYY/day_DD.txt`

Examples given have to be manually put in a test file under `/test/YYYY/day_DD.txt`
