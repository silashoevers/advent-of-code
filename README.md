# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges throughout the years. I have started participating actively since 2021.

## Language of Choice
My language of choice is Python because I am the most comfortable with it and it facilitates a high coding speed

## Repository structure
A lot of inspiration has been taken from this article on Real Python: [https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/)
It has inspired me to make use of a TDD approach next to providing me some useful libraries to use
